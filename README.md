* [fashion MNIST Classification](https://github.com/resfy/ML_Portofolio/blob/main/Image%20Processing/Fashion%20MNIST%20Classification.py): Classify fashion MNIST dataset into ten classes.
* [Handwriten MNIST Classification](https://github.com/resfy/ML_Portofolio/blob/main/Image%20Processing/Handwriten%20MNIST%20classification.py): Classify handwriten dataset into 10 class. Using callbacks for cancelling training process when validation accuracy > 98%
* [Horse vs Human Classification](https://github.com/resfy/ML_Portofolio/blob/main/Image%20Processing/Horse%20or%20Human%20Classification.py): Classify human and horse images. Avoid overfitting using image augmentation with image data generator.
* [Human vs Horse with transfer learning](https://github.com/resfy/ML_Portofolio/blob/main/Image%20Processing/Horse%20or%20Human%20With%20Transfer%20Learning.py): using inception V3 pretrained models.

### [Tensorflow Deployment](https://github.com/resfy/ML_Portofolio/tree/main/TensorFlow%20Deployment)
Learning resources of Tensorflow Deployment course (Coursera) include:
* tensorflow JS: model development using javascript (tensorflowJS), convert h5 models into JSON formats, and do transfer learning using tensorflowJS.
* tensorflow lite: Develop tensorflow lite models and prepare it for android/IoS/microcontrollers apps.
* tesnsorflow datasets
* tensorflow serving: Serving tensorflow models.
